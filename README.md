# Parkland Tai Chi

## Overview
This was our NAIT Web Design and Development capstone project. We were tasked with creating a website from the ground up for a non-profit Tai Chi organization. We were responsible for the prototyping and testing of the website, all graphic design elements (logo and icons) and the development of the website, using WordPress. 

## My role in this project
I was given the role of communication lead, which included the responsibilities such as, communicating with the client on a weekly basis, asking any questions, answering any question the client had and keeping them up to date with the development of the website. In addition to this I helped with of the develope with the development, migration and functionality of the website. As the project progressed I found myself in the role of Team Leader. I made sure that deadlines were met, work was done to a high standard and the customer received the best website we were able to design and develop. 

I also designed the logo for Parkland Tai Chi, It's a more modern take and a bit of a refresh of the logo that they had before. I also created an extensive user guide for them so that they have the ability to update their content without the help of a developer.

## Why did we use WordPress?
After extensive research and careful consideration, we decided that WordPress was the appropriate choice in which to develop Parklands website. We looked into using React and other CMS’s but the benefits that WordPress provided outweighed any negatives that it may have. They wanted to refresh their own content periodically and wanted stability now and, in the future, WordPress provides that. Since they are a non-for-profit organization, a low maintenance site is something that they required. 

## Project Status
The site about to be given to the client. The site is live on their hosting and is almost completed! Be sure to check it out!

## Challenges faced while making this
One of the challenges we faced during the design process was making decisions regarding the layout, color palette and overall design of the site. We all have different styles and tastes, so we had to find ways to take everyone’s ideas into consideration and balance that against the needs of the client. When we had to decide on certain things, we would always have a discussion followed by a vote. That way there wasn’t one member of the team making all of the decisions, and it felt fair. In the end this ended up working quite well, and as things moved along, we were given more autotomy to make decisions on the things we were working on, as we all had our tasks to complete. We would always make sure to consult with other members, however. We’ve all done group work before, but for most of us, not to this extent, so it was a great learning experience figuring out how to combine our ideas into one which would result in something that met all of the clients needs.
