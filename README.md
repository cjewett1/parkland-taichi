# Parkland Tai Chi - Site still in development, this will get updated as we continue to finalize the site!

## Overview
This was our NAIT Web Design and Development capstone project. We were tasked with creating a website from the ground up for a non-profit Tai Chi organization. We were responsible for the prototyping and testing of the website, all graphic design elements (logo and icons) and the development of the website, using WordPress. 

## My role in this project
I was given the role of communication lead, which included the responsibilities such as, communicating with the client on a weekly basis, asking any questions, answering any question the client had and keeping them up to date with the development of the website. 

## Why did we use WordPress?
After extensive research and careful consideration, we decided that WordPress was the appropriate choice in which to develop Parklands website. We looked into using React and other CMS’s but the benefits that WordPress provided outweighed any negatives that it may have. They wanted to refresh their own content periodically and wanted stability now and, in the future, WordPress provides that. Since they are a non-for-profit organization, a low maintenance site is something that they required. 

## Project Status
The site has been given to the client, is live on their hosting and is completed! Check sure to check it!

## Challenges faced while making this
One of the challenges we faced during the design process was making decisions regarding the layout, color palette and overall design of the site. We all have different styles and tastes, so we had to find ways to take everyone’s ideas into consideration and balance that against the needs of the client. When we had to decide on certain things, we would always have a discussion followed by a vote. That way there wasn’t one member of the team making all of the decisions, and it felt fair. In the end this ended up working quite well, and as things moved along, we were given more autotomy to make decisions on the things we were working on, as we all had our tasks to complete. We would always make sure to consult with other members, however. We’ve all done group work before, but for most of us, not to this extent, so it was a great learning experience figuring out how to combine our ideas into one which would result in something that met all of the clients needs.
